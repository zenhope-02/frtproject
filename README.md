# Fitment - Interior Design Project
This is my final Future Ready Talent project. It is an ecommerce site based on interior home design.

Deployed on Azure: https://mango-glacier-06043ee10.3.azurestaticapps.net
# Problem Statement:
The current interior design website lacks an engaging user experience, fails to effectively showcase design portfolios, and lacks personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and needs. Users struggle to find relevant design inspiration and have limited options for visualizing their own spaces. Furthermore, the website lacks an interactive platform for users to connect with professional interior designers, seek expert advice, and collaborate on design projects. This hampers the overall user satisfaction and inhibits the website's potential for attracting and retaining customers. Therefore, there is a need to revamp the interior design website to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and personalized platform that offers comprehensive design inspiration, tools for visualizing spaces, and seamless connectivity between users and professional designers.
# Project Description:
The project aims to develop and deploy an innovative interior design website on the Azure cloud platform. The website will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for individuals to explore, visualize, and collaborate on interior design projects. Leveraging the capabilities of Azure, the website will offer robust scalability, security, and performance to deliver an exceptional user experience.


The website can integrate with e-commerce platforms, offering a curated selection of furniture, decor, and other interior design products. Users will have the convenience of browsing and purchasing items directly through the website.


Additionally, a blog section will provide educational resources, articles, tutorials, and tips on interior design, home improvement, and trends, further enriching the user experience.


The deployment on Azure will ensure a reliable and scalable infrastructure for the website. Azure App Service will host the website, providing automatic scaling and high availability. Azure Blob Storage will store and serve design images and media files, while Azure SQL Database will manage user profiles, projects, and collaboration data securely. Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) will enhance website performance by caching static content globally, reducing latency and ensuring a smooth user experience.


By deploying the interior design website on Azure, the project aims to deliver a user-centric platform that offers comprehensive design inspiration, visualization tools, seamless connectivity between users and designers, and a secure and scalable infrastructure. The result will be an engaging and immersive interior design experience for users, fostering creativity, collaboration, and the realization of their design aspirations.
